# HelpSeeker
## An Application for the safety purpose of Women!
• Help seeker, as the name suggests, is an algorithm which if we look in the long run can be used significantly for helping people or specifically women, who inevitably get into trouble and needs help instantly. As if looked into the society we live in, we’ll see how crucial it is for us to do something in the matter of women safety, with an exponential increase in number of rape cases and other horrendous deeds, we felt the urge to do something that is different from the monotony in this subject.

• Our purpose with this is to design such an algorithm which considers the data of nearby people, as in the people close to the victim and selects particularly 5 people in order to send them a SOS message or a signal.

• The data of people that we are considering over here can be divided into two aspects:

• Distance: The 5 people which we are trying to select over here should be near or at least be in considerable distance to the victim so that they are within reach. This aspect is really crucial as the people we should be sending the SOS text should be able to reach timely and doesn’t let distance play a role in delaying their help.

• Rating: An another important key ingredient of the algorithm is ratings of the people, as in it defines how efficient the people would be with their help. Ratings of the people are given to them by the people they have helped so far in accordance with the excellence with which they have helped and will get updated with each person they help henceforth.

• The ones we are going to select, will be selected in accordance with these two above mentioned aspects which not only amplifies the probability of receiving help but also gives a further more optimized outcome.
